# ZK-Circuit


### Project Rubric:

1. **Write a correct circuit.circom implementation:**
   - Implement the circuit logic accurately in the `circuit.circom` file.

2. **Compile the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries:**
   - Compile the circuit to produce necessary intermediaries required for generating proofs.

3. **Generate a proof using inputs A=0 B=1:**
   - Generate a proof using specific inputs (A=0, B=1) to validate the circuit's functionality.

4. **Deploy a Solidity verifier to Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet:**
   - Deploy a Solidity verifier contract to either Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet.

5. **Call the verifyProof() method on the verifier contract and assert output is true:**
   - Invoke the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract and ensure that the output is true, indicating successful verification of the proof generated by the circuit.
